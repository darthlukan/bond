This is the story of two Python beginners making an IRC bot
using the sockets, then porting functions to the
twisted framework ( Hopefully :P ).

This is the bot James bond would use if he were to bother
with IRC!

========================================================================================
Bond IRC (bond)

This bot is meant as a toy for learning more about python.

It was coded on, tested on, and packaged completely on linux machines.  If you are using
python version 2.7.2 this package should be OS agnostic, however, as it was not tested on
a system with with "C:\", no claims of functionality are being made.

Again, this is a toy and as Thomas and I get better with Python, this program may or may not
be improved or even discarded completely.  In short, enjoy it for as long as you like or until
it breaks beyond repair.

========================================================================================

INSTALLATION:

Linux users may install this software as a user and should not need root.  Unpack the archive,
cd into bondirc/ and enter $ python setup.py install    in your terminal.  

NOTE: Some systems (*cough* Arch Linux and Gentoo *cough*) are already using Python 3.2 (Python3k).
These users should note that python2.7 may or may not be installed, but is required.  If you have more 
than one version of python installed, please use python2.7 as the command to install this package.

$python2.7 setup.py install



INITIAL SETUP:

In your favorite text editor, open the bond.py file and scroll down.  the final block of code begins as 

def run_bot(network ...


Change irc.freenode.net to your preferred network, and change '#channel' to your preferred channel.
If your port is different than '6667', please change it in the reactor.connectSSL and TCP lines.

Once that is done, save your changes and run the file.  The simplest way to run the bot
is to enter python bond/bond.py into your terminal as a user.  

========================================================================================

BASIC USE:

Once the bot is connected to your channel, there are a few pre-configured commands.

!repeat text = This command tells bond to echo whatever is said by this user.

example: <darthlukan> !repeat Python is the greatest programming language EVAR!

	*BondBot: Python is the greatest programming language EVAR!

!hug user = this command will cause bond to /me hug user.  There is a catch,
there are a few random actions pre-configured into the bot, all related to hugging.
If any of these actions are not to your liking, they can be changed in bond.py.

!slap user = A random action quite similar to a "slap".  Sometimes prefixed by the bot
with "pimp".

!kill user = It happens in IRC all of the time, sometimes you just can't get beyond
wanting to kill someone.  Luckily, bond has a license for such mayhem.  As with the previous
actions, our gentleman spy will choose his method of destroying your opponent at random.  Sometimes
with great pleasure.


google query = This is pretty simple.  google foo will return some google search results.

=========================================================================================

ADVANCED USE:

You will undoubtedly get tired of the limits of the initial install of bond.  That said, 
there is a reason why this program was written in python, so that it would be easy to learn on.
This is also an open source project, if you don't like something by all means, IMPROVE IT!

The bot itself is pretty simple, and adding your own commands is about as easy as it gets.
Find where the other commands are defined in bond.py and use them as a template to create your own.
More advanced options can be found by either learning python yourself, or using google.

For even more advanced use, see the qbranch.py file and add your own plugins there.
